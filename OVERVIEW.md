### Abstract
In this work, we critically review the existing literature on the neural mechanisms and cognitive processes involved in creative thinking and problem-solving. The paper discusses cognitive enhancement strategies based on neuroscientific insights to foster ideation and creative solutions.

### Purpose of This Repository
This GitHub repository provides the research paper in multiple accessible formats (PDF, HTML) for ease of reference. It also serves as a platform to facilitate academic discussions, community contributions, and ongoing updates to the research as new insights emerge.

### Contents
- **PDF and HTML files of the paper** are located in the `docs` folder.
- **Supporting documents** and future updates on research findings, resources, and related scientific discussions will be maintained here.

### How to Use This Repository
Researchers, students, and enthusiasts in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology are encouraged to:
- Access and review the research materials.
- Participate in discussions and contribute insights or related research findings.
- Share ideas and engage with the community for further exploration into cognitive enhancement and neuroscientific foundations of creativity.

We look forward to insightful exchanges and contributions from the community to advance the understanding of creativity from a neuroscientific perspective.
